# Are SDE models affected by personal opinion?
A stochastic differential equation (SDE) is a differential equation in which one or more of the terms is a stochastic process. In probability theory, a stochastic process, or random process, is a collection of random variables representing the evolution of some system of random values over time. SDEs have applications in a range of areas such as biology, physics, chemistry, mechanics and economics just to name a few. In finance future stock prices, interest rate movements, exchange rate fluctuations etc. can be modelled using SDEs. Since SDEs rarely have explicit solutions, numerical methods are very important to the study of SDEs. Numerical methods are used to obtain approximate numerical solutions to SDEs.
  Possibly the most well known SDE in the world of finance is geometric Brownian motion (GBM). A GBM is a continuous-time stochastic process in which the logarithm of the randomly varying quantity follows a Brownian motion with drift. In mathematical finance it is used to model stock prices in the Black-Scholes model. GBM is consistent with at least the weak form of the efficient market hypothesis (EMH), an investment theory that states it is impossible to "beat the market" because stock market efficiency causes existing share prices to always incorporate and reflect all relevant information. According to the EMH, stocks always trade at their fair value on stock exchanges, making it impossible for investors to either purchase undervalued stocks or sell stocks for inflated prices. As such, it should be impossible to outperform the overall market through expert stock selection or market timing, and that the only way an investor can possibly obtain higher returns is by purchasing riskier investments.
