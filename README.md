# Are SDE models affected by personal opinion?
A stochastic differential equation (SDE) is a differential equation in which one or more of the terms is a stochastic process. In probability theory, a stochastic process, or random process, is a collection of random variables representing the evolution of some system of random values over time. SDEs have applications in a range of areas such as biology, physics, chemistry, mechanics and economics just to name a few. In finance future stock prices, interest rate movements, exchange rate fluctuations etc. can be modelled using SDEs. Since SDEs rarely have explicit solutions, numerical methods are very important to the study of SDEs. Numerical methods are used to obtain approximate numerical solutions to SDEs.
