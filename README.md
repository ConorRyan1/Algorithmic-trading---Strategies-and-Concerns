### What is Algorithmic Trading?
**Algorithmic trading**, also called *algo trading* and *blackbox trading* usually refers to trading systems that are heavily reliant on complictaed mathematical formulas and high-speed computer programs to determine trading strategies, opening and closing positions etc. These strategies use electronic platforms to enter trading orders with an algorithm which executes pre-programmed trading instructions incorporating a variety of variables such as timing, price, and volume. Algorithmic trading is widely used by investment banks, pension funds, mutual funds, hedge funds etc.

 
### Strategies
Algorithmic trading may be used in any investment strategy or trading strategy, including market making, inter-market spreading, arbitrage. The investment decision and implementation may be augmented at any stage with algorithmic support or may operate completely automatically.

1. **Pairs Trading**
Pairs trading or pair trading is a long-short, ideally market-neutral strategy enabling traders to profit from transient discrepancies in relative value of close substitutes. In simpler terms, consider two mining companies with very similar cash flows, net profit etc. However one company trades for a P/E of 8, while the other trades for a P/E of 14. In this scenario one would buy the (cheaper) first company and short the stock of the second (more expensive) company.
